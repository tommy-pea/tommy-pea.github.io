My engineering courses focused on topics including operations research, statistics, stochastic modelling, data analysis and visualisation, feature engineering, time series analysis, machine learning, linear programming, integer and mixed-integer programming, algorithms for optimisation, mathematical modelling, calculus, and signal processing.

In music I studied violin with Stephen Larsen. Other courses included classical ensemble playing, music culture, musical interface design, pedagogical approaches, music production, and music theory.
