I work at WSP UK as a Consultant in their Transport Net Zero team. My highlight in this role has been developing a Dash application in Python to automate the assessment of road user emissions from transport model output. I played a critical role in developing the [Midlands Connect's Baseline Emissions Dashboard (a.k.a. MiOutcomes)][Midlands Connect Baseline Emissions Dashboard]{:target="_blank"} - a complex multi-page data visualisation and interaction web application developed in Dash Enterprise.
In the role, I've become an expert in carbon assessment for infrastructure projects.\
