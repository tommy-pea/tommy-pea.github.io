I currently work as a Consultant - Transport Net Zero at WSP UK in London, but am very open to exploring new opportunities.

I studied at the University of Auckland. 
I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with First Class Honours specialising in Engineering Science and a Bachelor of Music majoring in Classical Performance.

My engineering courses focused on topics including operations research, statistics, stochastic modelling, data analysis and visualisation, feature engineering, time series analysis, machine learning, linear programming, integer and mixed-integer programming, algorithms for optimisation, mathematical modelling, calculus, and signal processing.

In music I studied violin with Stephen Larsen. Other courses included classical ensemble playing, music culture, musical interface design, pedagogical approaches, music production, and music theory.
