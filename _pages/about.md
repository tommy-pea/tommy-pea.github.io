I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with First Class Honours specialising in Engineering Science and a Bachelor of Music majoring in Classical Performance from the University of Auckland.
My Engineering Science courses focused on topics including operations research, statistics, stochastic modelling, data analysis and visualisation, feature engineering, time series analysis, machine learning, linear programming, integer and mixed-integer programming, algorithms for optimisation, mathematical modelling, calculus, and signal processing.
In music I studied the violin under Stephen Larsen. Other music courses included classical ensemble playing, music culture, musical interface design, pedagogical approaches, music production, and music theory.

I currently work as a Consultant - Transport Net Zero at WSP UK in London.
I am starting to investigate new opportunities.
